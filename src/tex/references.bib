  abstract = {New insight into the temperature dependent evolution of internal strain in the austenite phase during the martensitic phase transformation in NiTi shape memory alloys is provided via classical molecular dynamics simulations that employ well-established interatomic potentials for NiTi. It is shown, for the first time, that the developed strain tensor in the austenite phase is tetragonal in nature, with exponential temperature-dependence. Equally importantly, it is found that the developed internal strain (parallel to the habit plane) in the austenite varies linearly with the evolving martensite phase fraction. Interestingly, the Richard's equation is found to describe the temperature dependence of the martensite phase fraction as well as the internal strain components parallel to the habit plane in the austenite phase. An analysis of the temperature dependent phonon dispersion of strained austenite revealed the competition between phonon softening of the TA2 branch and internal strain that leads to stabilization of the austenite phase in the two phase regime.},

  abstract = {For NiTi-based alloys, the shape memory effect is governed by a transition from a low-temperature martensite phase to a high-temperature austenite phase. Despite considerable experimental and computational work, basic questions regarding the stability of the phases and the martensitic phase transition remain unclear even for the simple case of binary, equiatomic NiTi. We perform ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to describe the temperature-dependent behavior of NiTi and resolve several of these outstanding issues. Structural correlation functions and finite temperature phonon spectra are evaluated to determine phase stability. We show that finite temperature, entropic effects stabilize the experimentally observed martensite (B19') and austenite (B2) phases while destabilizing the theoretically predicted (B33) phase. Free energy computations based on ab initio thermodynamic integration confirm these results and permit estimates of the transition temperature between the phases. In addition to the martensitic phase transition, we predict a new transition between the B33 and B19' phases. The role of defects in suppressing phase transformation temperatures is discussed.},

  abstract = {Phase transitions in nickel-titanium shape-memory alloys are investigated by means of atomistic simulations. A second nearest-neighbor modified embedded-atom method interatomic potential for the binary nickel-titanium system is determined by improving the unary descriptions of pure nickel and pure titanium, especially regarding the physical properties at finite temperatures. The resulting potential reproduces accurately the hexagonal-close-packed to body-centered-cubic phase transition in Ti and the martensitic B2-B19{${'}$} transformation in equiatomic NiTi. Subsequent large-scale molecular-dynamics simulations validate that the developed potential can be successfully applied for studies on temperature- and stress-induced martensitic phase transitions related to core applications of shape-memory alloys. A simulation of the temperature-induced phase transition provides insights into the effect of sizes and constraints on the formation of nanotwinned martensite structures with multiple domains. A simulation of the stress-induced phase transition of a nanosized pillar indicates a full recovery of the initial structure after the loading and unloading processes, illustrating a superelastic behavior of the target system.},
