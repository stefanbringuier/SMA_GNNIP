  abstract = {In a recent paper [Phys. Rev. B 63, 224115 (2001)], we proposed two equations of state based upon microscopic insight into the cohesion of a solid: the stabilized jellium equation of state (SJEOS) and its augmented version (ASJEOS). In this Reply, we address the issues raised by Holzapfel in his Comment on that paper. We show that, according to the number of independent fitting parameters used, our ASJEOS is comparable with Holzapfel's third-order adapted polynomial (AP3) and that the ASJEOS performs slightly better than AP3 for the materials (Al, Li, and Mo) and pressure range (P{$\lessequivlnt$}15Mbar) discussed in our paper. We compare the advantages and the disadvantages of ASJEOS and AP3, and discuss the behavior of the equations of state as they approach the strong-compression and strong-expansion limits.},

  abstract = {The program phon calculates force constant matrices and phonon frequencies in crystals. From the frequencies it also calculates various thermodynamic quantities, like the Helmholtz free energy, the entropy, the specific heat and the internal energy of the harmonic crystal. The procedure is based on the small displacement method, and can be used in combination with any program capable to calculate forces on the atoms of the crystal. In order to examine the usability of the method, I present here two examples: metallic Al and insulating MgO. The phonons of these two materials are calculated using density functional theory. The small displacement method results are compared with those obtained using the linear response method. In the case of Al the method provides accurate phonon frequencies everywhere in the Brillouin Zone (BZ). In the case of MgO the longitudinal branch of the optical phonons near the centre of the BZ is incorrectly described as degenerate with the two transverse branches, because the non-analytical part of the dynamical matrix is ignored here; however, thermodynamic properties like the Helmholtz free are essentially unaffected.

A tutorial is provided with the distribution which requires the installation of the quantum-espresso package (http://www.quantum-espresso.org) Nature of problem: Stable crystals at low temperature can be well described by expanding the potential energy around the atomic equilibrium positions. The movements of the atoms around their equilibrium positions can then be described using harmonic theory, and is characterised by global vibrations called phonons, which can be identified by vectors in the Brillouin zone of the crystal, and there are 3 phonon branches for each atom in the primitive cell. The problem is to calculate the frequencies of these phonons for any arbitrary choice of q-vector in the Brillouin zone. Solution method: The small displacement method: each atom in the primitive cell is displaced by a small amount, and the forces induced on all the other atoms in the crystal are calculated and used to construct the force constant matrix. Supercells of {$\sim$}100 atoms are usually large enough to describe the force constant matrix up to the range where its elements have fallen to negligibly small values. The force constant matrix is then used to compute the dynamical matrix at any chosen q-vector in the Brillouin zone, and the diagonalisation of the dynamical matrix provides the squares of the phonon frequencies. The PHON code needs external programs to calculate these forces, and it can be used with any program capable of calculating forces in crystals. The most useful applications are obtained with codes based on density functional theory, but there is no restriction on what can be used. Running time: Negligible, typically a few seconds (or at most a few minutes) on a PC. It can take longer if very dense meshes of q-points are needed, for example, to compute very accurate phonon density of states.},

  abstract = {Creating fast and accurate force fields is a long-standing challenge in computational chemistry and materials science. Recently, Equivariant Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for building machine learning interatomic potentials, outperforming other approaches in terms of accuracy. However, they suffer from high computational cost and poor scalability. Moreover, most MPNNs only pass two-body messages leading to an intricate relationship between the number of layers and the expressivity of the features. This work introduces MACE, a new equivariant MPNN model that uses higher order messages, and demonstrates that this leads to an improved learning law. We show that by using four-body messages, the required number of message passing iterations reduces to just one, resulting in a fast and highly parallelizable model, reaching or exceeding state of the art accuracy on the rMD17 and 3BPA benchmark tasks. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace.},

Similarly, we show that MEGNet models trained on {$\sim$}60 000 crystals in the Materials Project substantially outperform prior ML models in the prediction of the formation energies, band gaps, and elastic moduli of crystals, achieving better than density functional theory accuracy over a much larger data set. We present two new strategies to address data limitations common in materials science and chemistry. First, we demonstrate a physically intuitive approach to unify four separate molecular MEGNet models for the internal energy at 0 K and room temperature, enthalpy, and Gibbs free energy into a single free energy MEGNet model by incorporating the temperature, pressure, and entropy as global state inputs. Second, we show that the learned element embeddings in MEGNet models encode periodic chemical trends and can be transfer-learned from a property model trained on a larger data set (formation energies) to improve property models with smaller amounts of data (band gaps and elastic moduli).},

The M3GNet IAP was trained on the massive database of structural relaxations performed by the Materials Project over the past ten years and has broad applications in structural relaxation, dynamic simulations and property prediction of materials across diverse chemical spaces. About 1.8 million materials from a screening of 31 million hypothetical crystal structures were identified to be potentially stable against existing Materials Project crystals based on M3GNet energies. Of the top 2,000 materials with the lowest energies above the convex hull, 1,578 were verified to be stable using density functional theory calculations.

While most existing GNN models for atomistic predictions are based on atomic distance information, they do not explicitly incorporate bond angles, which are critical for distinguishing many atomic structures. Furthermore, many material properties are known to be sensitive to slight changes in bond angles. We present an Atomistic Line Graph Neural Network (ALIGNN), a GNN architecture that performs message passing on both the interatomic bond graph and its line graph corresponding to bond angles. We demonstrate that angle information can be explicitly and efficiently included, leading to improved performance on multiple atomistic prediction tasks. We ALIGNN models for predicting 52 solid-state and molecular properties available in the JARVIS-DFT, Materials project, and QM9 databases. ALIGNN can outperform some previously reported GNN models on atomistic prediction tasks with better or comparable model training speed.},

Although classical force fields often fail to describe the coupling between electronic states and ionic rearrangements, the more accurate ab initio molecular dynamics suffers from computational complexity that prevents long-time and large-scale simulations, which are essential to study technologically relevant phenomena. Here we present the Crystal Hamiltonian Graph Neural Network (CHGNet), a graph neural network-based machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) that models the universal potential energy surface. CHGNet is pretrained on the energies, forces, stresses and magnetic moments from the Materials Project Trajectory Dataset, which consists of over 10\,years of density functional theory calculations of more than 1.5\,million inorganic structures. The explicit inclusion of magnetic moments enables CHGNet to learn and accurately represent the orbital occupancy of electrons, enhancing its capability to describe both atomic and electronic degrees of freedom. We demonstrate several applications of CHGNet in solid-state materials, including charge-informed molecular dynamics in LixMnO2, the finite temperature phase diagram for LixFePO4 and Li diffusion in garnet conductors. We highlight the significance of charge information for capturing appropriate chemistry and provide insights into ionic systems with additional electronic degrees of freedom that cannot be observed by previous MLIPs.},

It is shown, for the first time, that the developed strain tensor in the austenite phase is tetragonal in nature, with exponential temperature-dependence. Equally importantly, it is found that the developed internal strain (parallel to the habit plane) in the austenite varies linearly with the evolving martensite phase fraction. Interestingly, the Richard's equation is found to describe the temperature dependence of the martensite phase fraction as well as the internal strain components parallel to the habit plane in the austenite phase. An analysis of the temperature dependent phonon dispersion of strained austenite revealed the competition between phonon softening of the TA2 branch and internal strain that leads to stabilization of the austenite phase in the two phase regime.},

Despite considerable experimental and computational work, basic questions regarding the stability of the phases and the martensitic phase transition remain unclear even for the simple case of binary, equiatomic NiTi. We perform ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to describe the temperature-dependent behavior of NiTi and resolve several of these outstanding issues. Structural correlation functions and finite temperature phonon spectra are evaluated to determine phase stability. We show that finite temperature, entropic effects stabilize the experimentally observed martensite (B19') and austenite (B2) phases while destabilizing the theoretically predicted (B33) phase. Free energy computations based on ab initio thermodynamic integration confirm these results and permit estimates of the transition temperature between the phases. In addition to the martensitic phase transition, we predict a new transition between the B33 and B19' phases. The role of defects in suppressing phase transformation temperatures is discussed.},

In this study, we investigate the thermodynamics of PtTi, a novel and promising SMA (and of the related better-known NiTi SMA, for comparison purposes) using recently developed first-principles computational method specifically designed to tackle this issue. The method efficiently explores the system's potential energy surface by discrete sampling of local minima, combined with a continuous sampling of the vicinity of these local minima via a constrained harmonic lattice dynamic approach.

  abstract = {We developed new interatomic potentials, based on the second nearest-neighbor modified embedded-atom method (2NN-MEAM) formalism, for Ti, Ni, and the binary Ti--Ni system. These potentials were fit to melting points, latent heats, the binary phase diagrams for the Ti rich and Ni rich regions, and the liquid phase enthalpy of mixing for binary alloys, therefore they are particularly suited for calculations of crystal-melt (CM) interface thermodynamic and transport properties. The accuracy of the potentials for pure Ti and pure Ni were tested against both 0 K and high temperature properties by comparing various properties obtained from experiments or density functional theory calculations including structural properties, elastic constants, point-defect properties, surface energies, temperatures and enthalpies of phase transformations, and diffusivity and viscosity in the liquid phase. The fitted binary potential for Ti--Ni was also tested against various non-fitted properties at 0 K and high temperatures including lattice parameters, formation energies of different intermetallic compounds, and the temperature dependence of liquid density at various concentrations. The CM interfacial free energies obtained from simulations, based on the newly developed Ti--Ni potential, show that the bcc alloys tend to have smaller anisotropy compared with fcc alloys which is consistent with the finding from the previous studies comparing single component bcc and fcc materials. Moreover, the interfacial free energy and its anisotropy for Ti-2 atom\% Ni were also used to parameterize a 2D phase field (PF) model utilized in solidification simulations. The PF simulation predictions of microstructure development during solidification are in good agreement with a geometric model for dendrite primary arm spacing.},

A second nearest-neighbor modified embedded-atom method interatomic potential for the binary nickel-titanium system is determined by improving the unary descriptions of pure nickel and pure titanium, especially regarding the physical properties at finite temperatures. The resulting potential reproduces accurately the hexagonal-close-packed to body-centered-cubic phase transition in Ti and the martensitic B2-B19{$\prime$} transformation in equiatomic NiTi. Subsequent large-scale molecular-dynamics simulations validate that the developed potential can be successfully applied for studies on temperature- and stress-induced martensitic phase transitions related to core applications of shape-memory alloys. A simulation of the temperature-induced phase transition provides insights into the effect of sizes and constraints on the formation of nanotwinned martensite structures with multiple domains. A simulation of the stress-induced phase transition of a nanosized pillar indicates a full recovery of the initial structure after the loading and unloading processes, illustrating a superelastic behavior of the target system.},

Atomistic mechanisms of this martensitic transformation (MT) and consequent emergence of its various low-symmetry structures are not understood yet. Starting with first-principles density functional theoretical calculations, we present here a phonon-based model and its statistical mechanical analysis to obtain atomistic insights into martensitic phases and transformation in NiTi. We uncover seven order parameters that are relevant to the MT in NiTi. From Monte Carlo simulations of an effective model Hamiltonian derived to capture its low energy landscape, we determine its soft phonons and establish the cell-doubling M5{$\prime$} mode as the primary order parameter. Using Landau theoretical analysis, we show that relative strengths of its third-order coupling with secondary order parameters (e.g. strain) determine the symmetry of low-T structures emerging at its MT. These couplings can be used as the descriptors of stability of martensitic phases that will guide the strategies to improve the shape memory of NiTi through substitutional alloying.},

  abstract = {The molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is a favored method in materials science for understanding and predicting material properties from atomistic motions. In classical MD simulations, the interaction between atoms is described by an empirical interatomic potential, so the reliability of the simulation hinges on the accuracy of the underlying potential. Recently, machine learning (ML) based interatomic potentials are gaining attention as they can reproduce potential energy surfaces (PES) of ab initio calculations, with a much lower computational cost. Therefore, an efficient code for training ML potentials and inferencing PES in new configurations would widen the application range of MD simulations. Here, we announce an open-source package, SNU Interatomic Machine-learning PotentiaL packagE-version Neural Network (SIMPLE-NN) that generates and utilizes the ML potential based on the artificial neural network with the Behler--Parrinello type symmetry function as descriptors for the chemical environments. SIMPLE-NN uses the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) package and Google Tensorflow for high expandability and efficient training, and also supports the in-house code for quasi-Newton method. Notably, the package features a weighting scheme based on the Gaussian density function (GDF), which significantly improves accuracy and reliability of ML potentials by resolving sampling bias that exists in typical training sets. For MD simulations, SIMPLE-NN interfaces with the LAMMPS package. We demonstrate the performance and usage of SIMPLE-NN with examples of SiO2.

  abstract = {Nickel-titanium (NiTi) shape memory alloys (SMA) are widely used, however simulating the martensitic transformation of NiTi from first principles remains challenging. In this work, we developed a neural network interatomic potential (NNIP) for near-equiatomic Ni-Ti system through active-learning based acquisitions of density functional theory (DFT) training data, which achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. Phonon dispersion and potential-of-mean-force calculations of the temperature-dependent free energy have been carried out. This NNIP predicts temperature-induced, stress-induced, and defect-induced martensitic transformations from atomic simulations, in significant agreement with experiments. The NNIP can directly simulate the superelasticity of NiTi nanowires, providing a tool to guide their design.},

  abstract = {We present a new interatomic potential for solids and liquids called Spectral Neighbor Analysis Potential (SNAP). The SNAP potential has a very general form and uses machine-learning techniques to reproduce the energies, forces, and stress tensors of a large set of small configurations of atoms, which are obtained using high-accuracy quantum electronic structure (QM) calculations. The local environment of each atom is characterized by a set of bispectrum components of the local neighbor density projected onto a basis of hyperspherical harmonics in four dimensions. The bispectrum components are the same bond-orientational order parameters employed by the GAP potential [1]. The SNAP potential, unlike GAP, assumes a linear relationship between atom energy and bispectrum components. The linear SNAP coefficients are determined using weighted least-squares linear regression against the full QM training set. This allows the SNAP potential to be fit in a robust, automated manner to large QM data sets using many bispectrum components. The calculation of the bispectrum components and the SNAP potential are implemented in the LAMMPS parallel molecular dynamics code. We demonstrate that a previously unnoticed symmetry property can be exploited to reduce the computational cost of the force calculations by more than one order of magnitude. We present results for a SNAP potential for tantalum, showing that it accurately reproduces a range of commonly calculated properties of both the crystalline solid and the liquid phases. In addition, unlike simpler existing potentials, SNAP correctly predicts the energy barrier for screw dislocation migration in BCC tantalum.},

  abstract = {Nickel titanium (NiTi) is a protypical shape-memory alloy used in a range of biomedical and engineering devices, but direct molecular dynamics simulations of the martensitic B19' -{$>$} B2 phase transition driving its shape-memory behavior are rare and have relied on classical force fields with limited accuracy. Here, we train four machine-learned force fields for equiatomic NiTi based on the LDA, PBE, PBEsol, and SCAN DFT functionals. The models are trained on the fly during NPT molecular dynamics, with DFT calculations and model updates performed automatically whenever the uncertainty of a local energy prediction exceeds a chosen threshold. The models achieve accuracies of 1-2 meV/atom during training and are shown to closely track DFT predictions of B2 and B19' elastic constants and phonon frequencies. Surprisingly, in large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, only the SCAN model predicts a reversible B19' -{$>$} B2 phase transition, with the LDA, PBE, and PBEsol models predicting a reversible transition to a previously uncharacterized low-volume phase, which we hypothesize to be a new stable high-pressure phase. We examine the structure of the new phase and estimate its stability on the temperature-pressure phase diagram. This work establishes an automated active learning protocol for studying displacive transformations, reveals important differences between DFT functionals that can only be detected in large-scale simulations, provides an accurate force field for NiTi, and identifies a new phase.},

  abstract = {Recent developments in many-body potential energy representation via deep learning have brought new hopes to addressing the accuracy-versus-efficiency dilemma in molecular simulations. Here we describe DeePMD-kit, a package written in Python/C++ that has been designed to minimize the effort required to build deep learning based representation of potential energy and force field and to perform molecular dynamics. Potential applications of DeePMD-kit span from finite molecules to extended systems and from metallic systems to chemically bonded systems. DeePMD-kit is interfaced with TensorFlow, one of the most popular deep learning frameworks, making the training process highly automatic and efficient. On the other end, DeePMD-kit is interfaced with high-performance classical molecular dynamics and quantum (path-integral) molecular dynamics packages, i.e., LAMMPS and the i-PI, respectively. Thus, upon training, the potential energy and force field models can be used to perform efficient molecular simulations for different purposes. As an example of the many potential applications of the package, we use DeePMD-kit to learn the interatomic potential energy and forces of a water model using data obtained from density functional theory. We demonstrate that the resulted molecular dynamics model reproduces accurately the structural information contained in the original model.

This hinders the computational design of complex SMAs with desirable properties. In this Letter we report that including the electronic free energy in the Gibbs free energy nearly reduces by half the large errors in previously predicted martensitic transition temperatures, and the controversy on the ground state of NiTi is resolved by reaching the convergence in free-energy calculations. In addition, the present results demonstrate that the martensitic transition path in stoichiometric NiTi is directly from B2 to B19{$\prime$} without intermediate phases.},

Our method provides a highly accurate prediction of density functional theory calculated properties for eight different properties of crystals with various structure types and compositions after being trained with \$10{\textasciicircum}4\$ data points. Further, our framework is interpretable because one can extract the contributions from local chemical environments to global properties. Using an example of perovskites, we show how this information can be utilized to discover empirical rules for materials design.},
