  abstract = {New insight into the temperature dependent evolution of internal strain in the austenite phase during the martensitic phase transformation in NiTi shape memory alloys is provided via classical molecular dynamics simulations that employ well-established interatomic potentials for NiTi. It is shown, for the first time, that the developed strain tensor in the austenite phase is tetragonal in nature, with exponential temperature-dependence. Equally importantly, it is found that the developed internal strain (parallel to the habit plane) in the austenite varies linearly with the evolving martensite phase fraction. Interestingly, the Richard's equation is found to describe the temperature dependence of the martensite phase fraction as well as the internal strain components parallel to the habit plane in the austenite phase. An analysis of the temperature dependent phonon dispersion of strained austenite revealed the competition between phonon softening of the TA2 branch and internal strain that leads to stabilization of the austenite phase in the two phase regime.},

  abstract = {For NiTi-based alloys, the shape memory effect is governed by a transition from a low-temperature martensite phase to a high-temperature austenite phase. Despite considerable experimental and computational work, basic questions regarding the stability of the phases and the martensitic phase transition remain unclear even for the simple case of binary, equiatomic NiTi. We perform ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to describe the temperature-dependent behavior of NiTi and resolve several of these outstanding issues. Structural correlation functions and finite temperature phonon spectra are evaluated to determine phase stability. We show that finite temperature, entropic effects stabilize the experimentally observed martensite (B19') and austenite (B2) phases while destabilizing the theoretically predicted (B33) phase. Free energy computations based on ab initio thermodynamic integration confirm these results and permit estimates of the transition temperature between the phases. In addition to the martensitic phase transition, we predict a new transition between the B33 and B19' phases. The role of defects in suppressing phase transformation temperatures is discussed.},

This knowledge is traditionally obtained via atomistic simulations, but these systems have so far resisted such efforts due to the presence of phonon instabilities and associated spontaneous symmetry breaking. In this study, we investigate the thermodynamics of PtTi, a novel and promising SMA (and of the related better-known NiTi SMA, for comparison purposes) using recently developed first-principles computational method specifically designed to tackle this issue. The method efficiently explores the system's potential energy surface by discrete sampling of local minima, combined with a continuous sampling of the vicinity of these local minima via a constrained harmonic lattice dynamic approach. Our calculations provide a complete and atomic-level-based model for these compounds' free energy and shed some light on the ongoing search for the precise structure of dynamically stabilized high temperature phases in SMAs.},

  abstract = {Phase transitions in nickel-titanium shape-memory alloys are investigated by means of atomistic simulations. A second nearest-neighbor modified embedded-atom method interatomic potential for the binary nickel-titanium system is determined by improving the unary descriptions of pure nickel and pure titanium, especially regarding the physical properties at finite temperatures. The resulting potential reproduces accurately the hexagonal-close-packed to body-centered-cubic phase transition in Ti and the martensitic B2-B19{${'}$} transformation in equiatomic NiTi. Subsequent large-scale molecular-dynamics simulations validate that the developed potential can be successfully applied for studies on temperature- and stress-induced martensitic phase transitions related to core applications of shape-memory alloys. A simulation of the temperature-induced phase transition provides insights into the effect of sizes and constraints on the formation of nanotwinned martensite structures with multiple domains. A simulation of the stress-induced phase transition of a nanosized pillar indicates a full recovery of the initial structure after the loading and unloading processes, illustrating a superelastic behavior of the target system.},

  abstract = {Remarkable shape memory property of Nitinol (NiTi) originates from a diffusion-free reversible phase transition it exhibits upon cooling from the cubic austenite to a low-symmetry martensite structure. Atomistic mechanisms of this martensitic transformation (MT) and consequent emergence of its various low-symmetry structures are not understood yet. Starting with first-principles density functional theoretical calculations, we present here a phonon-based model and its statistical mechanical analysis to obtain atomistic insights into martensitic phases and transformation in NiTi. We uncover seven order parameters that are relevant to the MT in NiTi. From Monte Carlo simulations of an effective model Hamiltonian derived to capture its low energy landscape, we determine its soft phonons and establish the cell-doubling M5{${'}$} mode as the primary order parameter. Using Landau theoretical analysis, we show that relative strengths of its third-order coupling with secondary order parameters (e.g. strain) determine the symmetry of low-T structures emerging at its MT. These couplings can be used as the descriptors of stability of martensitic phases that will guide the strategies to improve the shape memory of NiTi through substitutional alloying.},

Matter 12, L53 (2000)], which is based on the tight-binding model in second moment approximation. The model predicts a stable B19{${'}$} phase at low temperatures and a nearly cubic B2 phase at high temperatures. After an analysis of crystallography and energetics of the emerging structures, the experimentally known strong dependence of transition temperatures on composition is confirmed and related to lattice instability. Free-energy calculations finally give insight into the driving forces of the phase transitions and reveal free energy barriers inhibiting them below the transition temperatures.},

Phonon dispersion and potential-of-mean-force calculations of the temperature-dependent free energy have been carried out. This NNIP predicts temperature-induced, stress-induced, and defect-induced martensitic transformations from atomic simulations, in significant agreement with experiments. The NNIP can directly simulate the superelasticity of NiTi nanowires, providing a tool to guide their design.},

In this Letter we report that including the electronic free energy in the Gibbs free energy nearly reduces by half the large errors in previously predicted martensitic transition temperatures, and the controversy on the ground state of NiTi is resolved by reaching the convergence in free-energy calculations. In addition, the present results demonstrate that the martensitic transition path in stoichiometric NiTi is directly from B2 to B19{${'}$} without intermediate phases.},
